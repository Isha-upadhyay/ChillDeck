## Slide 2: Concepts in Learning

- Help students recognize and categorize examples by creating mental file folders in the brain.
- Vary in abstraction from specific to broad.
- Critical attributes are the criteria used to determine whether something is or isn't an example of a concept.
- Training students to be concept hunters helps them spot concepts in everyday life, current events, and pop culture.
- Using movement, modeling clay, drawing, etc., can help students describe critical attributes non-linguistically.
- Physical objects can represent concepts using critical attributes, and students can describe how they do so.
- Organizing thinking with concepts improves retention and transfer to new situations.
- Printable worksheets can target basic to complex temporal concepts, such as before/after, first/next/last, and first/second/third.

*Notes: Concepts are essential in learning as they help students recognize and categorize examples, improve retention, and transfer to new situations.*
